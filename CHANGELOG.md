# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.1.0] – 2026-09-28

First public release.

> The project was developed as **Jarvis** and renamed to **Orbwise** for this release. The assistant's default
> persona is still "Jarvis" ("Hey Jarvis"). Earlier installations are migrated automatically; the old `jarvis`
> command and `JARVIS_*` environment variables keep working as aliases and will be removed in 0.2.

### Assistant
- Local LLM via **Ollama** (Qwen 3 recommended) or any **OpenAI-compatible server** (llama.cpp `llama-server`,
  e.g. Bonsai 27B); switchable **model profiles**, Orbwise can start/stop the model server itself.
- Native tool calling with a **confirmation step** for anything that changes the system, a blocklist for
  destructive commands and root access through a **password field in the dashboard** (`sudo -A`).
- **Thinking mode** button: the model's reasoning is shown live inside the orb.
- Step limit with loop detection and a "continue" summary instead of a hard stop.
- German and English (`language: de|en`) – prompt, voice, speech recognition, UI and CLI.

### Voice
- Wake word "Hey Jarvis" (openWakeWord), push-to-talk, faster-whisper speech recognition.
- Piper text-to-speech with installable German and English voices and an optional "Jarvis" voice effect.

### Memory
- Persistent memory as readable Markdown files (daily journal, daily summaries, facts) plus a hybrid
  full-text/embedding index – no context-window overflow.
- **Chat history**: several chats, continue old ones, star them, delete them completely (including memory).
- Context budget follows the model's real context window; long tool results are trimmed instead of failing.

### Tools
- System: updates, install/remove/search packages (**pacman/AUR and apt**), system info, shell commands.
- System & network: processes, systemd services and logs, network info, ping, open ports, port check,
  disk usage and clean-up, power (shutdown, reboot, suspend, lock).
- Files & apps: find and open files (also on a NAS), read/write text files, launch applications, websites.
- Web search (Brave Search API, your own SearXNG or ddgs) and page fetching, weather (Open-Meteo), reminders
  and timers, a morning briefing with selectable items and order (weather, events and deadlines of the next
  days, Paperless inbox, news, updates, storage) – configurable in the config or the dashboard's PLANNER tab.
- Integrations: **Home Assistant**, **Paperless-ngx** (search, ask, open documents; suggest and apply
  correspondent, type, tags, title and date – also for many documents at once, after one confirmation),
  **Obsidian** vaults, **Trilium** notes and a **CalDAV/iCloud** calendar.
- **Routines**: tasks run automatically at set times (daily, weekdays or once), e.g. a web search every morning –
  created by voice or in the new **PLANNER** tab (which also holds reminders and the briefing settings); each
  routine writes into its own chat, confirmations are asked in the dashboard or declined when nobody is there.
- **E-mail** via IMAP – **Proton Mail through the Proton Mail Bridge** or any other mailbox: list unread mails,
  search, read (without marking as read), ask about a mail, archive/move/label/trash and PDF attachments to
  Paperless after confirmation, unread mails in the briefing. Mail content is passed to the model as untrusted
  data; after reading a mail, all further actions in that request need confirmation.
- Small context windows get only the tool groups that match the request; `tools.disabled` switches tools off.

### Web UI
- Animated neural-network orb, live telemetry (tokens/s, context, GPU, VRAM, RAM, power), activity log,
  memory browser, voice settings – optimised for smooth rendering in Firefox.

### Installation
- Installer for Arch-based and Debian/Ubuntu-based systems that asks for the language, the GPU (NVIDIA/AMD/CPU,
  pre-selected from detection, ROCm override for RX 6600/6700/7600) and the model from a VRAM-aware preset list.
- Add models later with `orbwise model add` or **+ ADD MODEL** in the web UI (download progress, fit marks).
- **Bonsai 2 27B** is set up automatically when chosen in the installer or with `orbwise model add bonsai`
  (Bonsai-demo checkout, llama.cpp binaries, model, GPU-specific server profile). On NVIDIA the CUDA runtime
  libraries are fetched automatically when the system has none.
- Web search via the official **Brave Search API** (key asked for by the installer) – no scraping of result
  pages and no bot blocking; SearXNG and ddgs remain as alternatives.
- `orbwise doctor`, `orbwise update`.

### Project
- MIT license, security policy, disclaimer and an overview of third-party components and their licenses.
